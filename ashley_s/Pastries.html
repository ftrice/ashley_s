        <div id="one"><h2>Croissants</h2><br>

            <h3>Butter Croissant</h3>
            <p>The traditional choice for breakfast or brunch, a ham sandwich or even bread pudding.</p>
            <h3>Chocolate Croissant</h3>
            <p>Our flaky croissant dough wrapped around chocolate pieces – simple, slightly sweet, and a hit with the
                kids.</p>
            <h3>Almond Croissant</h3>
            <p>A butter croissant split and soaked with a kirsch syrup, slathered with almond cream, and encrusted with
                sliced almonds.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Danish</h2><br>

            <h3>Cheese Danish</h3>
            <p>Flaky croissant dough folded around our vanilla cream cheese filling and dusted with powdered sugar.</p>
            <h3>Cinnamon-Raisin Roll</h3>
            <p>The classic, packed with large raisins and topped with cream cheese icing.</p>
            <h3>Fruit Snails</h3>
            <p>These change seasonally – some of our offerings include apple-crumb, Cherry, and vanilla blackberry
                peach. We offer 2 varieties daily.</p>
            <h3>Bacon & Cheese Danish</h3>
            <p>Our croissant dough folded around bacon and swiss cheese. Fantastic to eat cold or warmed in the
                oven.</p>
            <h3>Cherry Hearts</h3>
            <p>Croissant dough filled with cherry and cream cheese filling.</p>
            <h3>Rum Raisin Rolls</h3>
            <p>A Parisian standard – vanilla pastry cream and rum-soaked raisins rolled into our croissant dough.</p>
            <h3>Sticky Buns (with or without pecans)</h3>
            <p>Cinnamon-filled and caramel-covered, many of our customers buy dozens of these for family and office
                events.</p>
        </div>


        <div id="two"><h2>Puff Pastries</h2><br>

            <h3>Almond Pretzel</h3>
            <p>We layer our puff pastry with an almond filling, twist it up and shape it into a pretzel. Topped with
                sliced almonds and icing.</p>
            <h3>Chocolate Pretzel</h3>
            <p>Just like the almond version, this one gets layered with a chocolate filling and drizzled with icing.</p>
            <h3>Cinnamon-Pecan Swirl</h3>
            <p>This features layers of light pastry, sweet cinnamon filling and a handful of pecans on top. It’s a
                Turtle Bread classic.</p>
            <h3>Fruit Boats</h3>
            <p>In the summer we fill these with blueberries and cinnamon, and in the winter we fill them with apples.
                Encrusted with sparkly sugar.</p>
            <h3>Cherry Turnover</h3>
            <p>Puff dough filled with cherry filling.</p>
            <h3>Sacristan</h3>
            <p>Simple twists filled with vanilla pastry cream and dusted with powdered sugar, they’re great for
                mid-morning coffee.</p>


        </div>
        <div id="three"><h2>Muffins</h2><br>


            <p>Our muffins are just that – they’re not cupcakes, nor giant warehouse monstrosities. We use brown sugar
                for comfort and buttermilk for a bit of tang, and add fruits and nuts for flavor and crunch. The bakers
                make 3 or 4 kinds of muffins daily – call your local shop for availability:</p><br>

            <p>Blueberry</p>
            <p>Raspberry</p>
            <p>Chocolate Chip</p>
            <p>Bran</p>
            <p>Banana Walnut</p>
            <p>Lemon Poppy</p>
            <p>Cherry Almond</p>
            <p>Pumpkin Muffin (Winter Seasonal)</p>
            <p>Apple Hazelnut Bran (Winter Seasonal)</p><br>


            <h2>Scones</h2><br>

            <p>We have 2 types of scones – a buttermilk-based version which we fill with dried fruits, and our
                incredibly popular Cream Scone (which you can also buy frozen to bake at home). None of them are overly
                sweet, and all of them are a perfect match for your favorite coffee:</p><br>

            <p>Orange Chocolate Chip</p>
            <p>Golden Raisin Ginger</p>
            <p>Oatmeal Currant Cream</p>
            <p>Blueberry (summer)</p>
            <p>Ginger Hazelnut (winter)</p>
