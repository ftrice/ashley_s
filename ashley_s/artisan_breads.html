            <h3>Baguette (Baked Daily)</h3>
            <p>The hallmark of all bakers – we take great pride in ours classic baguette. Best served fresh. If you have
                day old baguettes, we suggest making crostini: Slice, toss with olive oil and salt and toast.</p>
            <h3>Spinach Bread</h3>
            <p>This is a delicious bread to serve with roasted meats, poultry or vegetables. Baked on Fridays.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Spinach, Olive Oil, Salt, Yeast, Garlic, Nutmeg, and Egg
                Wash.
            </p>
            <h3>Pain de Campagne</h3>
            <p>We use the same dough as our baguette to make this big round loaf. It keeps longer and is the
                quintessential “every day” bread – it can be eaten with absolutely anything. Baked everyday.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast</p>
            <h3>Germ Levain</h3>
            <p>We use a special flour from Great River Organic Milling to make this bread – it’s got great wheat flavor
                and has an incredibly moist crumb. Eat with a soft, rich cheese like Havarti or Ridder, and don’t worry
                about it going stale – it keeps for up to a week! Baked on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

                Ingredients: Partially Sifted Whole Wheat Flour, Water, Whole Wheat Levain, Unbleached Wheat Flour,
                Salt</p>
            <h3>Green Olive</h3>
            <p>This is a true olive loaf – rich with olive oil and packed with juicy Sicilian olives, it’s very good
                served with a simple pasta dinner or with an antipasti platter. Baked on Thursdays and Saturdays.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Whole Wheat Flour, Green Olives, Semolina, Water, Olive Oil, Salt,
                Yeast, Malt Powder; brushed with Egg before baking</p>
            <h3>Rosemary Olive Levain</h3>
            <p>We add lots of rosemary and kalamata olives to our Germ Levain dough to make this loaf – it’s a perfect
                addition to any cheese platter and a superb choice for a grilled mozzarella sandwich. Baked on
                Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

                Ingredients: Partially Sifted Whole Wheat Flour, Water, Whole Wheat Levain, Unbleached Wheat Flour,
                Salt</p>
            <h3>Sourdough</h3>
            <p>One of our most popular breads, this crusty loaf has a pleasingly complex flavor from the small amount of
                rye and whole wheat flour. Slice thin, brush with olive oil and toast to serve with cheese; or slice
                thick and serve to sop up stews and braised meats. Baked everyday.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Whole Wheat Levain, Rye, Salt, Yeast</p>
            <h3>Sourdough Rye</h3>

                definitely want this bread. Baked on Thursdays.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Rye Flour, Whole Wheat Levain, Salt, Caraway Seeds</p>
            <h3>Stirato</h3>
            <p>Our version of ciabatta (stirato means “stretched” in Italian, referring to the way we transfer them to
                the oven), this bread is chewy and goes with everything. Our favorite way to eat it is to slice thick
                pieces, brush with olive oil and grill – chewy and crunchy and a perfect match for grilled chicken.
                Baked everyday.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast</p>

            <h3>Sunflower Rye (Loaf and Baguette)</h3>
            <p>This beautiful loaf is pictured in the bottom right of this page. A well-balanced rye bread chock full of
                toasted sunflower seeds, this has rapidly become one of our most popular loaves. It’s great with a
                well-aged white cheddar, and kids like it too! Baked everyday except Mondays.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Rye Flour, Sunflower Seeds, Molasses, Whole Wheat Levain,
                Oil, Salt, Yeast</p>

                Mondays and Saturdays.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Potato Flour, Sugar, Milk Powder, Butter, Salt, Yeast</p>

                your sauciest and salami-est creations with ease. Baked everyday.

                Ingredients: Unbleached Wheat Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast</p>

            <p>Available only during the holidays, this is the roll the bakers steal off the racks more than any other.
                They pack a bit of heat and provide a decidedly un-Minnesotan counterpoint to your traditions.</p>
            <br>

        <div id="three"><h2>Pan Loaves</h2>
            <h3>Multi Grain</h3>
            <p>True to form, this loaf is packed with nine grains and sprouted wheat berries. It’s nutty-tasting and
                moist, not dry and saw-dusty like some other versions out there. It makes a great sandwich – one of our

            <p>This is your basic white bread, but with integrity. It is absolutely essential for BLTs or plain grilled
                cheese sandwiches – the surface crisps beautifully and the inside stays soft. (Call to special order a
                loaf without egg wash if you have egg allergies.) Baked on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

            <h3>Honey Whole Wheat</h3>

                syndrome”. It’s a must-have for tuna-on-toast. Baked on Mondays and Wednesdays.
